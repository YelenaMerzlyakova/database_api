# Read me database_api

Published API : <https://elena-notes-api.herokuapp.com/>

possible extensions to the API :

* read.php
* list.php
* delete.php
* ...

The mission was to create an API that can save notes and later on to add a web interface for it ([see my note-app-front-end repository](https://github.com/YelenaMerzlyakova/vue-app)).

The learning objectives were : 

* Using MySQL databases
* The difference between SQL and NoSQL
* CRUD
* Understanding HTTP request types
* Pull requests and reviews

I have used a SQL database (mySQL, phpmyadmin) because it was better structured. Checkout my other repositories for a project with a NoSQL database.
